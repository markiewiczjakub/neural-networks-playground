# Neural Networks Playground

This repo is my personal space for learning and experimenting with Python and neural networks.  
I use it to try out ideas, test code, and understand how things work under the hood.

Expect messy notebooks, small scripts, and random experiments.  
Nothing here is prod-ready, itâ€™s just for learning.
